Builds complete HTML pages in an output folder using a template and an input folder of incomplete HTML pages

Install
  There is an executable in the releases section. Download the *.exe if you are on Windows and the un-extended file
  if you are on Linux or macOS. Run as you would a normal comamnd in your terminal. You may have to give the file
  executable permissions.
  
  If neither file runs on your system, you can build a new one using Go. Install the Go langauge on your system from
  https://go.dev/ and run "go build websiteBuilder.go" in your terminal to make a new one for your system's architecture.

Usage
  $ website_builder <input folder> <output folder> <template> <token>
